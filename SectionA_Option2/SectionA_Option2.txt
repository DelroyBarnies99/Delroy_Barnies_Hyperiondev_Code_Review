Your on your way to completing this task! 


Aspects of the submission that could be improved:

Great work, but unfortunately your code doe's not run due to an "Unresolved compilation problem" error. On line 27 you returned 
"reverseString" instead of the "reverse_string" method which you defined. 
Also on line 31 you have duplicate variable names.


Overall feedback

Great Submission overall, very well done! Just fix the problems mentioned above and I'll take another look.
